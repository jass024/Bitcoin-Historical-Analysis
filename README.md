# Bitcoin-Historical-Analysis
Performed comprehensive time-series analysis on 14+ years of Bitcoin historical data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly). Calculated key technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, volatility) to identify market trends, potential anomalies, and areas of regulatory concern. Visualized results using interactive Plotly charts.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin's historical price, volume, and volatility data from 2010 to 2024. It leverages advanced data analysis techniques in Python, creates interactive visualizations, and investigates potential anomalies relevant to regulatory compliance. The project is designed to provide insights into Bitcoin's market dynamics and support data-driven decision-making for investors and regulators.

## Project Goals

*   Uncover long-term price trends, volatility patterns, and key market events that influenced Bitcoin's price.
*   Identify potential anomalies or patterns indicative of market manipulation or regulatory violations.
*   Assess the risk profile of Bitcoin investments based on historical volatility and price trends.
*   Provide an educational resource for understanding Bitcoin's market behavior and associated risks.

## Key Features

*   **Data Analysis:**
    *   Calculated daily returns, volatility, and various moving averages (SMA, EMA) to understand price trends.
    *   Analyzed volume patterns to gain insights into market activity.
    *   Computed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:**
    *   Created dynamic Plotly charts to visualize price trends, volatility, daily returns, RSI, moving averages, and total volume by month.
*   **Anomaly Detection (Optional):**
    *   Explore statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify unusual price movements or trading patterns. (Implementation in progress)

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Plotly
*   **Data:** Historical Bitcoin data (CSV format)

## Repository Structure
